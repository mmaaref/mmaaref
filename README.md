- 👋 Hi, I’m Mounir Maaref - I am currently working for Samsung in Cambridge UK as a Principal Systems Architect 
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics hardware and embedded software co-design, System-on-Chips architecture design, and system modeling using SystemC/TLM2 as well as gem5. I have also authored a book on SoCs titled Architecting and Building High Speed SoCs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning gem5 and specifically the Ruby modeling to be able to create multi-CPUs heterogenous system architectures mostly based on ARMv7 ad ARMv8 architectures with different profiles (A/M/R)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on gem5 technical aspects related to multi-CPUs modeling in FS mode using the Ruby cache model.
- 📫 You can reach me on my personal email address (mounir.maaref@gmail.com) and via LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/mounirmaaref/
